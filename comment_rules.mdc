# Comment Rules

The `@commentmeta.json` file holds the metadata that must be referenced whenever inserting or updating X++ comments. For every change in `.xpp` under `parserXPO`:

- `developer` must always be `a.klychn`.
- `date` must be the current date (`today`) at the moment the comment is inserted.
- `project` must be read from `"project"` inside `@commentmeta.json`.

Maintain the existing `// developer date project` syntax, and ensure the `project` token is freshly fetched from `@commentmeta.json` before writing any comment. This keeps the metadata in sync with the source of truth while honoring the Rule documented in `@comment_rules`.
